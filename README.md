# High-Speed-Design-Approaches-For-CCSDS-LDPC-Encoder-Systems
Develop a more efficient method for encoding Quasi-Cyclic Low-Density Parity-Check codes.   Implement this approach on  FPGA ( Basys 3 board) to demonstrate its practical feasibility and effectiveness.  The main goal is to achieve a notable speedup in encoding speed compared to existing methods while keeping resource utilization low.
